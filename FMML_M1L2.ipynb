There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance."

        "   - **Accuracy Impact:** Increasing the percentage of the dataset allocated to the validation set usually leads to a more accurate and stable estimate of the model's performance. A larger validation set reduces the variance in the accuracy measurement because it includes a more diverse sample of data, better reflecting the overall population.\n",
        "   - **Training Set Reduction:** However, increasing the validation set size reduces the size of the training set. With fewer examples to learn from, the model may underfit, leading to lower performance on both the validation set and the test set. This trade-off means that the model's performance might not fully capture the complexity of the data, as it had less information to learn from.\n",

As a result, the model might perform better on unseen data, assuming the training data is representative of the test data.\n",
        "   - **Variance in Validation Accuracy:** However, a smaller validation set may not be as representative of the overall data distribution. This can lead to higher variance in the validation accuracy, making it a less reliable indicator of the model’s performance on the test set. Small validation sets might also fail to capture the full range of data variability, leading to an overly optimistic or pessimistic estimate of test performance.\n",

This typically leads to better performance on the test set. However, if the training set is too large and the validation set is too small, the accuracy estimated from the validation set may not be reliable, which can lead to an inaccurate prediction of test accuracy.\n",

        "### 1. **Averaging Validation Accuracy Across Multiple Splits**\n",
        "   - **Consistency:** Averaging validation accuracy across multiple splits typically gives more consistent results because it reduces the variability associated with a single train-validation split. Each split may perform differently due to the randomness of data splitting, but averaging helps to smooth out these fluctuations, providing a more stable estimate of the model's performance.\n",
        "   - **Accuracy Estimate:** It generally provides a more accurate estimate of the test accuracy. When you average the results, you're effectively reducing the bias and variance in the accuracy estimate, making it closer to what you'd expect on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Effect of Number of Iterations on the Estimate**\n",
        "   - **Higher Iterations:** Increasing the number of iterations (i.e., the number of different splits you average over) tends to improve the reliability of the estimate. With more iterations, the average accuracy converges to a value that better represents the model's expected performance on new data. However, the improvement diminishes after a certain point—additional iterations yield diminishing returns in terms of accuracy improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Dealing with Small Training or Validation Datasets by Increasing Iterations**\n",
        "   - **Small Datasets:** For very small training or validation datasets, increasing the number of iterations can partially compensate for the lack of data by providing a more robust estimate. However, there's a limit to how much this can help. If the datasets are too small, no amount of iteration can fully overcome the issues of overfitting or underfitting, and the model's performance will still be constrained by the limited data.\n",

        "     - **Number of Splits:** More splits can lead to more robust and reliable estimates of accuracy, as mentioned earlier. However, this also means that each individual training set is smaller, which might reduce the model’s performance if the dataset is not large enough.\n",
        "     - **Split Size:** Larger training splits (i.e., more data in the training set) generally lead to better performance because the model has more data to learn from. However, if the training set becomes too small, the model's performance will likely degrade.\n",
        "   - **Comparison with 1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN):** The 1-NN classifier often has higher variance compared to 3-NN. This is because 1-NN is more sensitive to noise in the data—since it only considers the closest neighbor, any outlier or noisy point can drastically change the prediction. The 3-NN classifier, by averaging over three neighbors, tends to be more stable and less sensitive to noise, leading to better performance in many cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Exercise: How Does the Accuracy of the 3-NN Classifier Change with the Number of Splits?**\n",
        "   - **With More Splits:** As you increase the number of splits, the accuracy estimate becomes more reliable, but individual split accuracy may fluctuate. The average accuracy across splits will likely stabilize as the number of splits increases.\n",
        "   - **Effect of Split Size:** Smaller split sizes may result in lower accuracy for 3-NN, as the model has less data to learn from. However, if you increase the number of splits while keeping the split size constant, you may get a better estimate of the true accuracy.\n",
